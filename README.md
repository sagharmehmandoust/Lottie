# React-lottie network-aware loading

Using React and a network hook, this web animation employs Lottie. It assesses the user's network connection strength to determine if it should present the Lottie animation or a static poster image

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
